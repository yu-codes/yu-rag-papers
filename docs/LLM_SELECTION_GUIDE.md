# LLM Model Selection Guide

This guide is designed to help individuals or teams choose the most suitable Large Language Model (LLM) based on their needs for usage, customization, or workflow integration.

## 1. Fundamental Decision Flow

### 1. Do you have privacy, intranet, or security restrictions?

* Yes

  * Do you have your own GPU hardware?

    * Yes → Consider deploying an open-source LLM
    * No → Use enterprise SaaS services like Azure OpenAI / Claude Enterprise
* No

  * You can use cloud APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Groq...)

### 2. Do you need the most up-to-date and powerful models?

* Yes → GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro
* No

  * Do you have a budget constraint?

    * Yes → GPT-3.5, Claude 3 Haiku, Mistral on Groq
    * No → Use GPT-4o / Claude 3 Sonnet

### 3. Do you need fine-tuning or customization?

* Yes

  * Do you have GPU access or support?

    * Yes

      * What kind of fine-tuning do you prefer?

        * LoRA / QLoRA → Recommended: Phi-3, Mistral 7B, Yi-6B, Command R+, Gemma 2B/7B
        * Full fine-tuning → Recommended: LLaMA3-13B, Yi-34B (requires multiple GPUs)
    * No → Use cloud training services (RunPod, AWS EC2, Paperspace...)
* No → Use available model APIs or systems

### 4. What is your primary application scenario?

* General conversation, text understanding → GPT-4o, Claude 3, Yi-6B, Gemma 7B
* Code generation, design → GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, CodeLlama, StarCoder2
* Multimodal (image + language) → GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3 Opus
* Document search / RAG tasks → Command R+, Mistral + RAG
* Optimized for Chinese → Yi-6B, ChatGLM3, Baichuan2, Breeze-7B

## 3. Fine-Tuning and Execution Design Suggestions

### Fine-Tuning Methods

* LoRA / QLoRA: Great for limited GPU resources, highly efficient
* Full Fine-tuning: Requires large GPU RAM, produces best performance
* Prompt tuning: Lightweight, ideal for quick customizations

### Recommended Tools

* HuggingFace Transformers, PEFT, Datasets
* bitsandbytes, DeepSpeed, Flash Attention 2
* Execution frameworks: Axolotl, OpenChatKit, vLLM

## 4. Conclusion

Choosing the right LLM should consider your use case, budget, deployment method, and need for customization.

* If you want the latest and strongest: GPT-4o / Claude 3 Opus
* If you want self-hosting or fine-tuning: Phi-3, Mistral, Yi
* If Chinese support is key: Yi, ChatGLM3, Breeze
* If you need RAG or document-based search: Command R+, Mixtral
